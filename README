Testing Scripts
--

A collection of scripts I've written to help automate various security testing tasks.  Most of them are focused on analyzing the (sometimes verbose) output of various security tools and condensing this into concise reports for analysis.

There's some documentation at [https://github.com/raesene/testingscripts/wiki](https://github.com/raesene/testingscripts/wiki).
